### To Do

# develop flipped classroom model
I'm very interested in converting some of my materials to an online, interactive tutorial for the purpose of developing a flipped classroom model.  Below is a link to my lecture materials. 
The PDF files contain the narration text, formulas, and R code. Most slides have narration and formulas on the left, and the corresponding R code on the right.
For example you can take a look at time_series_multivariate.pdf
I also provide .R files containing the code, so that students can execute the code as they listen to the lecture. The lecture materials also contain .RData files with sample data.

### thoughts

I'm more interested in building an assembly line of quantitative trading models, rather than crafting a single trading model.
Bring quantitative trading models into the industrial age. 

# Prerequisites for algorithmic trading strategies
Algorithmic trading requires a pipeline of strategies, not just a single strategy that looks promising. 
Algorithmic trading requires a strategy lifecycle. 
The critical question is when should a strategy be retired?  If it hits a stop-loss?  How to determine stop-loss amount?  Using bootstrap of backtesting, to determine potential drawdowns and distribution of potential returns. 

Strategies that trade infrequently can't really be tested properly. 
Strategies that identify a few successful trades 
High frequency data is needed for quant strategies for several reasons. 
machine learning isn't effective for strategies that trade infrequently (weekly, monthly)
machine learning requires trading events 
strategies which trade more often (intraday)
for learning

bias-variance tradeoff

Optimization in the presence of noise leads to spurious 



# The reason skewness caught my attention as an indicator is because of the Amaya paper that I cited in my presentation.  There's growing research showing that positive skewness in stock returns may predict their lower future returns.  The analogue is buying options.  When you buy an option you get positively skewed returns, but you must also pay an option premium, which lowers future returns.  

# Finance theory states that it's not possible to obtain positive returns without taking risks (there's no free lunch)
One of the basic principles of finance theory is the relationship between risk and return on investment.
It doesn't mean that taking risk guarantees positive returns, because there are many strategies with lots of risk but no positive returns.  
It means that the best performing strategies that do produce positive returns can't avoid taking risks.
It also means that strategies that don't take any risks can't produce positive returns.

# Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) states that higher returns are only possible by taking more risk
We first select all the strategies that take the same level of risk, and then we select the best performing strategy from those strategies.  
Then we compare the returns of these best performing strategies with their levels of risk.
The CAPM states that the returns of the best performing strategies are proportional to their levels of risk.
In other words, you can't obtain higher returns without taking more risk.  
But the CAPM doesn't promise higher returns for taking more risk, since ther are many strategies with lots of risk but no positive returns.  

# Finance theory states that arbitrage isn't possible in well functioning markets
Arbitrage means buying something at a lower price and immediately selling it at a higher price.  
Arbitrage is a strategy that doesn't take any risks, and finance theory states that it therefore shouldn't be able to produce positive returns either.  
Even though arbitrage shouldn't be possible in well functioning markets at equilibrium, arbitrage is often possible in real markets.

# Statistical arbitrage involves buying something at a lower price and selling it later at a higher price, or vice versa, first selling it and later buying it back at a lower price.  
Statistical arbitrage is based on past statistical observations of price patterns, and occurs on a scale of several days or less.  
Statistical arbitrage isn't riskless, since it involves owning a position for some time.  
But statistical arbitrage is able to reduce risk on average over many trading cycles.  

# Investors have a desire for assets with positive skewness, similar to lottery tickets (options). 
This may be caused by 
reduces their future returns. 

low beta anomaly caused by demand for positive skewness (lottery) which reduces future returns  
Bali Betting Against Beta Lottery Demand.pdf  
Recent academic research is suggesting the existence of risk premia associated with higher moments of the return distribution.
For example skewness (third moment) is believed to predict lower future returns.
This may be caused by investor demand for assets with positive skewness (lottery tickets), which reduces their future returns. 
We explore this phenomenon using high frequency data, since it allows for more accurate and timely estimation of higher order moments (bias-variance tradeoff).
Furthermore, we also explore the interaction between skewness and the momentum factor, since some recent research is suggesting that momentum returns are enhanced by skewness.
But using high frequency data can present a challenge, since the data size may cause R programs to run very slowly.
We demonstrate how to perform the analysis using vectorized R code designed for speed.
We present our results using interactive visualizations afforded by new R packages.

### trading strategy ideas:

# is VIX trading volume able to forecast returns, or is volume just a proxy for volatility?

# VIX Futures term structure strategies
http://quantpedia.com/Screener/Details/198

# VIX/SPX trading strategies
http://www.bloomberglabs.com/quantitative-finance/research/vixspx-trading-strategies/
SPX mean reversion strategy using the spread between daily and weekly realized variance
VIX futures pair/spread strategy using the term-structure of VIX futures

# short SPX ATM puts strategy
http://www.thestreet.com/story/12770794/1/a-simple-options-trading-strategy-that-beats-the-sp-500.html

# test strategy where you exploit trending into market close:
jump on the trend in the last hour, then reverse position at the close, and reverse again at next day open

# perform portfolio optimization using two time scales (lookback periods)
estimate correlation matrix on a long lookback period
estimate returns on a short lookback period
the bias-variance tradeoff for correlation should be different than for returns
it's better to estimate returns on a short lookback period, but there's 
no benefit to use short lookback period for estimating correlation 

# perform running portfolio optimization assuming zero or constant correlations
update correlations over longer lookback periods 
perform running portfolio optimizations over shorter lookback periods 
invest in the portfolio based on its trailing return
use variance forecasts (instead of realized variance) to estimate portfolio variance 
demonstrate that this portfolio is forecastable in-sample
demonstrate that it's also forecastable out-of-sample
explore shrinkage: does it improve forecastability?
explore long-only weights: that is just index (market portfolio)
explore mean reverting strategy: over intra-day period apply rule:
if realized return is higher than expected, then reduce long position, and vice versa
similar for expected negative return

# instead of optimizing portfolio for highest Sharpe, optimize for highest forecastability
is highest forecastability similar to lowest variance?
answer: highest Hurst exponent 
can Hurst exponent be forecast?
create scatterplot of many portfolios: variance versus Hurst exponent 
use package ForeCA by Georg M. Goerg at Google NYC

calculate portfolio indicator similar to Sharpe: portfolio return divided by volatility

# forecastable component analysis package ForeCA
# find beta that maximizes Hurst
portfolio of stock plus beta times index
what is the beta that maximizes the portfolio's Hurst exponent?
is the beta stable over different intervals out-of-sample?

http://www.bearcave.com/misl/misl_tech/wavelets/hurst/doc/index.html

# regress running Hurst exponent versus running volatility
regress running Hurst exponent versus returns over same lag

# if variance can be forecast, then forecasts can be used in pairs rebalancing trading
buy SPX and VIX and rebalance when SPX becomes cheap and vice versa
entry points are determined by forecasted volatility of SPX and VIX

# study periods of high volatility (variance) spikes
calcuate histogram of volatility - what's the distribution? chi-squared?
fit the chi-squared distribution using MoMoments

# identify periods around volatility spikes - say 100 bars before and after
what's the distribution of returns from period start to peak volatility,
and from peak volatility to period end?

# calculate Hurst exponent for volatility spikes, before min and after min
are returns autocorrelated around volatility spikes? yes
draw scatterplot of daily Hurst exponent versus volatility
draw scatterplot of Hurst exponent versus volatility spikes

create ARIMA model where autocorrelation term is weighted by level of VIX
create ARIMA model with correlation of returns to level of VIX
	negative correlation means returns are skewed to downside when VIX is high

# calculate daily seasonality of Hurst exponent

# forecast stock index using VIX
high VIX produces high future returns
invest SPX notional inverse to VIX level

# study trading strategy that is short at period start, then flips long 
and rides recovery

# forecast price bottom or volatility peak from moving averages
is there some scaling law?

# forecast variance using different models
variance can be forecast using GARCH
create indicator of variance trend from two VW Avg Variance
does the forecast variance also help to forecast returns?

# divide time into periods of low volatility and high volatility
calculate Hurst exponent in each period

# create trading strategy 
thesis: volatility is forecastable, 
returns are forecastable in periods of high volatility
identify when volatility will spike, and follow return trend in periods of high volatility

# perform Gram–Schmidt procedure to obtain PCA
repeat Gram–Schmidt procedure but maximize Hurst or SR, instead of variance
interpret the max Hurst components and observe how they change
regularize the procedure (shrinkage)
regress the max Hurst components against SPY

# draw scatterplot of daily SD versus daily returns

# create trading strategy with dual indicators
slow indicator for momentum and fast indicator for mean reversion
trade only on fast indicator, but bias its positions using slow indicator
when slow indicator indicates long position, 
then fast indicator should switch between long and flat positions, and vice versa

# (07-15-16) S&P500 has reached a new high but defensive stocks are leading the rally, and stock picking funds have not profited despite low stock correlation
http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ede9f018-49cf-11e6-b387-64ab0a67014c.html
Both stocks and bonds have rallied in anticipation of further low interest rates and central bank stimulus.
Low volatility stocks and high-yielding stocks have outperformed, because they are substitutes for bonds. 
Defensive stocks such as utilities, real estate and telecoms have also outperformed, which is typical for the end of the business cycle, before profits fall and a recession starts.
Stock correlation has dropped since May 2015, with 109 stocks gaining at least 20%, and 96 falling at least 20%. 
But stock picking funds have not profited, with equity hedge funds producing a small negative return in 2015, and a small negative return so far in 2016.

# (05-31-16) Value stocks have underperformed growth stocks since 2006, the longest losing stretch in history
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-31/lost-decade-for-value-stocks-tests-faithful-who-say-end-is-nigh
In the 1990s growth stocks outperformed drastically, then in 2000-2006 value stocks outperformed drastically.
Currently banks make up about 30% of large-cap value stocks, and their underperformance since 2006 largely explains the underperformance of value stocks.
Low interest rates have held back bank stocks, and the repeated failure of rate hikes have kept bank stock prices low. 
But 2016 may be a turning point for value stocks.
Value stocks in the Russell 1000 Index have gained 4.3% in 2016, compared with 1.1% for growth and 2.7% in the S&P500. 
The KBW Bank Index has jumped 18% in the past three months, double the increase of the S&P500. 
Strong global economic growth is needed for value stocks to outperform.

# Manoj Narang creates new firm to combine high frequency trading with statistical arbitrage strategies
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-11/a-high-speed-trading-pioneer-spots-a-new-way-to-make-big-returns
High frequency trading relies on "structural" information about the order book, and profits mostly on front-running other traders by guessing their intentions. 
High frequency trading uses prices and order book data at around milisecond frequencies, and holds positions for seconds or less, and requires very fast connections to exchanges. 
Statistical arbitrage identifies statistical anomalies in asset prices, and profits by betting that those anomalies will revert back to equilibrium values. 
Traditional statistical arbitrage uses daily prices to identify price anomalies, and holds positions for at least several days.  
Manoj Narang is a veteran high frequency trader who recently left Tradeworx. 
Manoj Narang's new fund will focus on volatility arbitrage. 

# (04-05-16) Stock picking funds in 1Q16 have underperformed the market by the most in two decades
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-05/lockstep-moves-ease-futility-doesn-t-for-u-s-equity-managers
Correlation between stocks is at the lowest levels since 2012, which should be good for stock pickers. 
But stock picking funds owned the wrong stocks, because the stocks that were unloved by stock picking funds outperformed the ones they loved by the most since 2013, with lower quality stocks rallying.
Portfolio managers made a mistake by avoiding utility and consumer staples stocks, while buying financial and technology stocks.
Stocks that performed the worst in 2015 rallied by 8.2% in the first quarter of 2016.
Momentum strategies also lost money because trends quickly reversed, as the S&P first lost 10% but then recovered.

Stocks ranked highest by analysts have fallen on average 11% in 2016, while stocks ranked lowest are down only 3.4%.
This is tied to the reversal of high momentum stocks, many of which are owned by hedge funds.  
The stocks that are the most owned by hedge funds are trailing the S&P500 by 4.6% in 2016, after outperforming by an average of 10% per year over the last four years.

The top 10% most costly to short underperformed the market by a record 26% in 2015, which is the widest split between winners and losers since the 1990s.  Even as the S&P dropped only 0.7% in 2015, the average decline in the 10 worst stocks was 64%, while the 10 best surged 71%.  This divergence is mostly due to commodity companies underperforming and some technology companies outperforming.

# Bloomberg Tradebook Trader Exercises
https://traderbrainexercise.com/
Denise Shull, founder of ReThink Group, New York consulting firm that coaches financial professionals and athletes:
Superior judgment of risk requires multiple cognitive and emotional abilities, that allow acquiring knowledge, recognition of reality, and understanding.  
These include the ability to create mental models to predict prices, emotional self-awareness (knowing when emotions interfere with good judgment), and the ability to read other people's minds.

# Andrew Lo experiments show that good traders have more control over their emotions, and are flexible in response to risk and market volatility
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-01/wall-street-s-next-frontier-is-hacking-into-emotions-of-traders
Andrew Lo observed volunteers in a simulated trading game, and measured the trader's stress levels by measuring their perspiration and heart rate.
Lo's study found that good traders responded to stressful situations quickly, but afterwards calmed down quickly as well, leaving them better prepared for future challenges. 
On the other hand, poor traders remained emotionally charged even after the volatility subsided. 
Lo’s study suggests that there’s a sweet spot for emotional engagement: too much, and you’re overly aggressive or fearful; too little, and you aren’t involved enough to care. 
Having too much or too little emotion made for poor trades. 


# Caltech researcher Peter Bossaerts found that traders use "theory of mind" when they make trading decisions
http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-19/neuroscience-may-help-train-your-brain-for-trading
fMRI scans show that parts of the brain associated with the "theory of mind" are activated when traders try to forecast prices.
Traders that were better at predicting prices were also better on other tests of "theory of mind" abilities.

# People who are unsure and slow to make judgments are better decision makers
https://hbr.org/2016/07/slow-deciders-make-better-strategists
Researchers created a competitive strategy game, and analyzed the performance of different types of participants, based on their speed and confidence. 
The game participants were categorized into four groups according to their speed of making judgments, and their own confidence of their judgments.
Older men were over-represented among the two groups with high confidence, while women were over-represented in the group that was unsure and slow to make judgments (the "I-don't-knows" group).
It turned out that the "I-don't-knows" group was the best performing group in the game.

# The availability heuristic explains why individual investors overestimate risk by giving too much weight to recent bad news reports
http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2016-04-29/the-mistake-that-separates-most-traders-from-the-pros
Robert Shiller has been polling investors for 26 years, asking them to estimate the likelihood of a severe crash (daily decline of at least 12.82%) over the next six months. 
The mean investor estimate over those 26 years has been 19%, and the average 10%, while the actual probability is closer to about 1%.
Goetzmann, Shiller, and Kim scanned news stories for both positive and negative words, and found that investors gave excessive weight to the most recent information in deciding on the probability of a crash. 
They found that when media reports contain more negative news, then individual investors provide a significantly higher estimate of crash risk. 
Individual investors are also much more influenced by negative news than by positive news. 
Positive words in media reports (such as "advance" or "boom") had no impact on individual investors estimates of crash risk. 
But institutional (professional) investors were not influenced by news at all.

# Jim O'Shaughnessy behavioral finance book What Works on Wall Street: humans less reliable than algos
http://jimoshaughnessy.tumblr.com/post/127484251129/the-unreliable-experts-getting-in-the-way-of
Human experts perform worse than quantitative models because the don't apply their own ideas properly - they don't trust simple rules, even though they know they work. 
Quantitative models outperform human experts because they consistently apply the same rules without doubting them.
Daniel Kahneman studied cognitive biases: over-confidence, optimism, hindsight, illusion of control. 
Hindsight bias makes it appear that events that the best informed experts did not anticipate often appear almost inevitable after they occur.
Predictions can be made through either intuitive (clinical ), or quantitative (statistical) methods, or a combination of them.
In the intuitive methods, predictions are made based on personal knowledge, experience, and common sense. 
Heuristics are "rules of thumb" which forecasters can use to make decisions or forecasts.
The quantitative method doesn't rely on heuristics nor subjective judgments.
The quantitative method uses relationships between empirical data and the desired outcomes to reach conclusions. 
Paul Meehl 1954 study of quantitative prediction versus intuitive prediction. 
Meehl reviewed 20 studies comparing clinical and statistical predictions for three things: academic success, response to electric shock therapy, and criminal recidivism. 
Meehl found that simple quantitative models outperformed the human judges. 
In predicting academic success in college a model using just high school grade point average and the level attained on an aptitude test (such as the SAT) outperformed the judgment of admissions officers at several colleges. 
Robyn Dawes in his book House of Cards also found quantitative models to be superior. 
L.R. Goldberg devised a simple model using the results of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), to distinguish between neurosis and 
psychosis of patients. 
The model achieved a success rate of 70%, while no human expert could achieve a success ratio of 67%. 
Humans don't like to follow models: even when human judges were given more information than the models and were given the result of the models before being asked for prediction, the quantitative models still beat the human judges.
A Wall Street Journal article from September 16, 2004 pointed out that blindly following Value Line's stock picks vastly outperformed the Value Line mutual fund, which aimed to follow Value Line's stock picks, but failed to stick to them.
Humans don't utilize base rate information if there is descriptive data.
Humans prefer descriptive data to impersonal statistics. 

# Behavioral finance papers showing that stock markets are not efficient
http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-06-09/finance-has-caught-on-to-behavioral-economics
Robert Shiller famous 1981 paper shows that stock prices fluctuate more than fundamentals warrant.
Richard Thaler 1985 paper shows that stock prices over-react.
Kelly Shue and Stefano Giglio paper shows that stock prices of merger targets
don't rise gradually as merger becomes more likely merger after announcement.
After a merger announcement the stock price of merger target should grow 
gradually as time passes after the merger announcement, since it slowly becomes 
more likely the merger will be finalized.
But in reality stock prices grow with time much less than they ought to.

# There are only two types of strategies: mean reversion or trend following
# The best risk metric for mean reverting strategies is the tail ratio
# A simple rule of thumb is to redeem mean reverting strategies if losses are below 0.4 of turnover
# Trend following strategies have tail ratios ranging from 3 to 10. 
# Winners are much bigger than losers. 
# So, tail ratio is meaningless for trend followers.
# Trend following risk is not in the tails, but in the aggregates
# Risk of trend following strategies is best measured by the ratio of profits over 
# losses. The risk metric for trend following strategies is therefore: Gain to Pain Ratio

https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/derivative-securities/forward-futures-contracts/v/backwardation-bullish-or-bearish
Contango is a state where the futures price is higher than the spot price.
A contango is normal for non-perishable commodities that have a cost of carry, and for stable or bear markets.
Backwardation is a state where the spot price is higher than the futures price.
Backwardation typically occurs during bull markets.
In contango the futures curve is upward sloping, and in backwardation it's downward sloping.
The shape of the futures curve in bull and bear markets reflects the market's expectations of price reversion to the mean.
If prices are high today, they are expected to revert lower (backwardation), and vice versa in contango.
In contango, futures bull spread trades (buy nearby contract and sell distant contract) earn a positive carry, reflective of the cost of carry of the physical commodity.
Volatility futures behave reversely to stock futures, since a bull market in volatility represents a bear market for stocks.
Volatility futures are upward sloping in stock bull markets (low volatility), and downward sloping in stock bear markets (high volatility).

http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-10-20/how-entire-short-volatility-etf-complex-could-be-wiped-out-overnight
XIV rebalancing creates posiitive feedback loop in VIX, because when VIX rises then XIV needs to buy VIX.  Thus XIV has huge negative convexity. 
Example was during the August 24th crash, when SPX futures opened limit down and VIX futures didn't open for 30 minutes. 
When VIX opened it was 25 points higher at 53.29, before falling to 28 intra-day, then rebounding to 40.74 by the close, with the S&P 500 index down -3.9%.
This was historically record breaking volatility-of-volatility despite relatively mild historical declines in the S&P 500 index.

# F-Squared Investments Receives Wells Notice From SEC
http://online.wsj.com/articles/f-squared-investments-received-wells-notice-from-sec-1409768768
F-Squared says it uses mathematical models to generate signals to buy and sell among a range of ETFs, which track a variety of global stock and bond markets.

http://online.barrons.com/articles/SB50001424053111904780504580049961992594040
Managed portfolios are the hottest trend in asset management. 
Managed portfolios are similar to asset-allocation mutual funds built with low-cost, passive ETFs.
But advisors have very little track record.
Many of their managed portfolios are based on back tests and financial engineering. 
F-Squared Investments is the biggest, managing $28 billion.
F-Squared Investments admitted it overstated its past performance
Be sure your manager's track record is real. 
Windhaven Investment Management, with $19 billion, is second.
Good Harbor Tactical Core U.S. is a popular aggressive strategy, but is down by 10.2% as of midyear 2014. 
Good Harbor suffered when small-company stocks and other high-momentum sectors broke down in early 2014.
Good Harbor's CIO is Paul Ingersoll.

# Managed ETF performance has been dismal
http://online.barrons.com/articles/why-etf-managed-accounts-fail-1412404692
Separate "wrap" accounts with a five-year track record have underperformed.
Tactical strategies try to ride the market’s uptrends and avoid its downtrends by getting out before losses are too great. 
iSectors Post-MPT Growth Allocation, employs macro-economic signals to determine its allocations. 
Its 18.3% five-year annualized return beats 99% of its peers in the world allocation category, 
but still slightly lags the S&P 500’s 18.8% return. 
The market is up-down, up-down, and even when it rises, it goes up too quickly.
So almost all tactical strategies are getting in after the market’s already gone up.
They’re inadvertently buying high and selling low—just the opposite of what you want to be doing.

# iSectors offers a suite of 15 ETF-based asset allocation models
http://isectors.com/post-mpt-strategies/

# Dimensional Fund Advisors beats the market consistently
http://us.dimensional.com/
http://assetbuilder.com/investing/dfa_vs_vanguard
http://online.barrons.com/news/articles/SB50001424053111904742804579284652021894432
Dimensional's funds all operate on the same principles -- that it's hard to beat the market, and impossible to do it consistently, by stock-picking. There are, however, various factors that can be exploited to provide market-beating returns. 
Its process is simple and repeatable -- and yet no other firm has tried emulating it. When asked why, co-founder, chairman, and co-CEO David Booth, 67, draws a surprising analogy to Star Wars, and Luke Skywalker's inability to harness the power of the Force until his devotion was deep and unwavering.
Trade execution is critical to another factor that Fama and French added to their model more recently: Stocks that are falling tend to continue to fall, and those that are rising tend to continue to rise. "So you want to trade slowly," Booth says. "We are slow to trade most of the new names that have recently fallen into the value category, because they are negative-momentum stocks. We're also slow to sell positive-momentum stocks. We'll hold on for years."

# David Booth co-founded Dimensional Fund Advisors in 1981
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_G._Booth
Booth was a research assistant to Eugene Fama.
Dimensional manages about $360 bn and invests in small (low capitalization) and value (low price/book ratio) stocks and non-U.S. stocks. 
David Booth gave $300 mm to the University of Chicago's School of Business, now named after him.

# Nassim Nicholas Taleb: Antifragile systems posses a convexity bias through tinkering (trial and error)
https://edge.org/conversation/nassim_nicholas_taleb-understanding-is-a-poor-substitute-for-convexity-antifragility
Convexity bias allows systems to gain from "disorder cluster", like volatility, uncertainty, disturbances, randomness, and stressors. 
Antifragile systems gain from uncertainty and they favor optionality. 
Convexity is easier to attain than knowledge.
Antifragile systems favor simplicity (premium for simplicity). 
Optionality works by negative information: by avoiding things that don't work, instead of choosing things that do work. 
This allows accidentally discovering things that do work.

# difference between prediction and forecasting
http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/65287/difference-between-forecast-and-prediction
http://www.analyticbridge.com/forum/topics/difference-between-prediction
A prediction is a definitive and specific statement about when and what event will occur, for example: there will be an earthquake in Southern California this December.
A forecast is a probabilistic statement, usually over a longer time scale, for example: there is a 60% chance of an earthquake in Southern California over the next thirty years.
Forecasting can be considered a subset of prediction. 
In statistical regression analysis, predictions are in-sample model outputs, while forecasts are out-of-sample model outputs.
Nate Silver in The Signal and the Noise:
The term "predict" comes from Latin, while the term "forecast" comes from English Germanic.
In ancient times prediction was associatied with fatalism, fortune-telling, and superstition.
Forecasting reflects the new Protestant worldliness rather than the otherworldliness of the Holy Roman Empire. 
Making a forecast typically implied planning under conditions of uncertainty. It suggested having prudence, wisdom, and industriousness, more like the way we now use the word foresight.

Just before the referendum vote on Thursday, the probability for the remain vote implied by betting odds reached 90% probability for remain.
Financial markets were also wrong, as they rallied into the vote.

Make three estimates: high, low, and mid.
That makes middle estimate closer to expected value, than a two-number range would.
Make two forecasts and take the average. 
Premortem prospective hindsight: imagine a future failure and then explain the cause of it.
Take an "outside view" of project.

# Philip Tetlock book Superforecasting: Amateur forecasters are better than experts
http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/09/25/can-you-see-the-future-probably-better-than-professional-forecasters/
Philip Tetlock runs the Good Judgment Project.  
Amateur forecasters in the Good Judgment Project were about 30% more accurate than experts, even those with access to classified information.
Amateur forecasters were coached to be ruthlessly honest to themselves about their convictions, and why they hold them.
Amateur forecasters were coached to search for information that might disprove their convictions, and to change them at will, as often as new evidence emerged.
Amateur forecasters were coached to think in terms of probabilities in an uncertain world.
The best amateur forecasters were called superforecasters.
The superforecasters were more careful, curious, open-minded, persistent and self-critical (as measured by psychological tests) than others.
Superforecasters regard their views as hypotheses to be tested and adjusted, rather than certainties.
Experts are more confident and arrogant, and less willing to adjust their views.
Most experts are too quick to make up their minds and too slow to change them. 
Experts are also paid not just to be right, but to sound right, cocksure even when the evidence is sparse or ambiguous.
98% of economists expected interest rates to rise in 2014, but they fell instead.
Most energy analysts didn’t foresee oil price collapse in 2014.

Wisdom of crowds works well only when there's proper diversity, aggregation,

Incentives can be part of a feedback loop.
