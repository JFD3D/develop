*** Estimating risk and performance measures: volatility, skew, CVaR, Cornish-Fisher VaR=Modified VaR, risk-return ratios (Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar), package PerformanceAnalytics, 

Normal (Gaussian) distribution is a bad model for price returns, 
because extreme returns are frequent and determine the mean
For example, half of the return of the stock market over the past 50 years 
was associated with just 10 days with the greatest daily change (Taleb) ? 

# use MAD instead of STDEV
http://edge.org/response-detail/25401
The Pareto distribution has infinite variance but has finite MAD. 
Show that when volatility is stochastic then STDEV is much higher than MAD.
create plot displaying ratio of STDEV over MAD as function of volatility of volatility. 
Show that ratio of STDEV over MAD is related to kurtosis

# add: slide for measures of dispersion:
Maximum absolute deviation
trailing range stat
Hurst

# demonstrate the persistence autoregression of volatility in real return data
fit GARCH model into real return data

# fit returns into Pareto distribution

# create study of bias-variance tradeoff using volatility estimation example:
1. create xts of random prices with changing time-dependent deterministic vol parameter, 
2. estimate volatility use look-back window parameter, 
3. too short look-back window increases variance, 
4. too long look-back window increases bias, 
5. tune filter parameters in-sample: study bias-variance tradeoff, 
6. create rCharts and shiny visualizations

# estimate volatility using OHLC data
demonstrate that estimator standard error is lower using OHLC data
use bootstrap to determine estimator standard error confidence intervals 
use simulated data with constant volatility

*** CAPM model: market portfolio, regressions of asset returns, alpha, beta, CML, SML, package PerformanceAnalytics, 

in this course we will study both investment and speculation
The main difference between investment and speculation lies in the time horizon.
Investment is concerned with capturing returns on the long-run with lower risk, while speculation is concerned with achieving returns over a short period of time. 
Speculation attempts to switch between investments to achieve the best return versus risk.
Investment attempts to choose the best investments and hold onto them to achieve the best return versus risk over the long term.

# add: Equity premium puzzle
returns on stocks are much higher than predicted by CAPM model using volatility of equity returns and returns on government bonds
The fact that stocks are riskier than bonds doesn't explain the magnitude of the difference, 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_premium_puzzle

# add: derive CAPM from utility
CAPM = market return is frontier return
The efficient frontier consists of convex combinations of any two efficient frontier portfolios.
Any convex combination of efficient frontier portfolios is also an efficient frontier portfolio.
the Market Portfolio is the optimal portfolio with the highest utility
the Market Portfolio isn't necessarily equal to the portfolio of all assets
how can Market Portfolio be obtained ?
Market Portfolio can be obtained by optimizing Sharpe ratio
Market Price of Risk == highest Sharpe ratio
logarithmic utility implies max Sharpe ?
derive Security Market Line (SML) from Capital Market Line (CML) ?
if the residuals of returns in SML were correlated with each other, 
then a different Market Portfolio would exist
portfolios on the CML satisfy the SML equation
provide reasons why CAPM may not hold? 
Market Portfolio isn't same as highest Sharpe portfolio

*** Factor models: CAPM, Fama-French, Barra, statistical, 

Distinguish between cross-sectional regressions (in-sample), 
and predictive regressions (out-of-sample), 

Statistical factor models examine returns over many time periods, and from them identify relationships between and among the different assets, unlike fundamental factor models, which from the outset group assets that are likely to experience similar returns.

Guttman (1954) and Kaiser (1960, 1970), asserted that in order to be significant, “a factor must account for at least as much variance as an individual variable” (Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994). 
Horn proposed that factors should only be considered significant if they explain a greater proportion of variance than what might be expected from random chance.

# Value strategies can be implemented in many different ways, leading to widely different performance 
http://investorfieldguide.com/three-value-investors-meet-in-a-bar/
Stock value can be measured in several different ways including book value, earnings, and sales. 
The Russell 1000 Value has underperformed the Russell 1000 by -22% and the Russell 1000 Growth by -43% over the past decade (10 years ending 11/30/15). 
idea: apply value investing to different value indices: buy more of the cheap ones

# factor data mining: 24 return factors forecast monthly stock returns
Green Factor Models Stock Forecasting.pdf
quote:
Fama and French (1992, FF92) measured the dimensionality of the cross-section of 
expected monthly U.S. stock returns by regressing the potential factors beta, 
firm size, book-to-market, earnings-to-price and leverage. 
They found that beta was not explanatory of expected returns, but size and 
book-to-market were, and that they absorbed the explanatory power of 
earnings-to-price and leverage. 
FF92 concluded that the cross-section of expected monthly U.S. stock returns was 
two-factor, although neither factor was consistent with the CAPM. 
A third factor in the form of 12-month return momentum (Jegadeesh, 1990; 
Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993) was incorporated by Fama and French (1996) and 
Carhart (1997) to create the three-factor model of risks that explain equity returns.

# most predictive factors of monthly stock returns from Green Factor Models
sue	standardized unexpected earnings
bm	book-to-market
mom12m	12-month momentum
mom36m	36-month momentum
chfeps	Change in forecasted annual EPS
ear	three-day return centered on the most recent earnings announcement

Regularization (shrinkage) is an example of Occam’s Razor, which was postulated 
by the fourteenth-century philosopher Sir William of Ockham. 
Occam’s Razor states that the most likely solution to be correct is the 
simplest solution, and that any solution should not be more complicated 
than necessary ("the law of parsimony").

Bogle Investing Factor Models.pdf
Bogle's message is: it's better to invest in indices, 
unless you're a genius stock picker or a genius speculator. 

Bogle postulates that long-term returns on investments consist of an "investment 
return" (initial yield plus earnings growth) plus the "speculative return" 
(discount factor determined by investor psychology and risk appetite).  
The cumulative investment return is positive, while the cumulative speculative 
return is close to zero.

# simulate 500 correlated stocks time series random lognormal with positive drift, 
use them for random portfolios
create a value-weighted index
show that the index investors are inherently trend-following
because index keeps buying more of the outperforming stocks
compare to equally weighted index
which investors perform better?

# show that:
terminal price distribution is very skewed
most paths are below expected value
if we start with a portfolio of 500 stocks, most will underperform
therefore most randomly selected portfolios will underperform the index
therefore most PMs who randomly select portfolios will underperform the index

Antti Ilmanen: 
The equity risk premium (ERP) refers to the expected return of a broad equity 
index in excess of some fixed-income alternative.
Arnott (Research Affiliates):
The ERP Puzzle: Stocks beat bonds by more than they should. 
Historical excess returns exhibit large negative correlation.
The correlation between consecutive 10-year stock market excess returns 
over 10-year government bonds has been a whopping –38 percent. 
When stocks beat bonds by a wide margin in one decade, they reversed with 
reasonable reliability over the next decade.
This correlation is both statistically significant and economically meaningful.

# Smart Beta doesn't outperform
Jacobs:
Glushkov found the Sharpe ratios of smart beta funds and their benchmarks to be nearly identical, at 0.46 versus 0.48, respectively, while the average information ratio was 0.08, inconsistent with the idea that smart beta ETFs offer a distinct advantage over traditional cap-weighted indexes. Furthermore, according to an analysis performed for Reuters by ETF.com, and reported in Barlyn [2015], recent smart beta performance results have been disappointing.

# distinction between long volatility strategies and short volatility strategies
mean reverting strategies have natural profit caps (exit when price has reverted to mean) but no natural stop losses (we should buy more of something if it gets cheaper), so it is very much subject to left tail risk, but cannot take advantage of the unexpected good fortune of the right tail. 
On the contrary, momentum strategies have natural stop losses (exit when momentum reverses) and no natural profit caps (keep same position as long as momentum persists).

# data mining for factors
# create synthetic time series with correlations using factors, and extract the factors
how much data is needed to obtain accurate estimates?
# create synthetic time series without correlations
show that bogus factors are extracted with high t-values

# System Parameter Permutation (SPP): 
we don't know the appropriate model parameters for the best future performance, 
so run the model using all possible parameter permutations, to obtain a distribution 
of possible future performance.

# create heatmap of model parameters using expand.grid
# calculate histogram of performance on model parameters
the median serves as the best estimate of true strategy performance
The median performance can be used as the best estimate of future strategy performance

SPP can answer the question, what is distribution of short-run performance
short-run performance
worst-case contingencies must be tolerated in in order to achieve the long-run expectation? 

# perform grid search of model parameters on heatmap
find max and min and indices with arr.ind=FALSE
# plot grid heatmaps 3d charts
# use random data to show that optimal in-sample parameters are not best out-of-sample, because of noise in-sample
# show that the best out-of-sample parameters depend on level of noise
# with lower noise level, the best out-of-sample parameters is closer to the optimal in-sample parameters

# data resampling: divide your data into non-overlapping segments
# within each segment find the optimal in-sample strategy parameters 
# create distribution of optimal in-sample strategy parameters from all the segments 
# create distribution of strategy performance from all the segments 
# the distribution of performance provides an estimate of possible future strategy performance 
# summarize the distribution of strategy performance (mean and SD ?)
# this summary provides an estimate of the strategy's usefulness potential 
# create benchmark random data with the same moments as the real data - shuffle real data ? 
# compare the distribution of strategy performance for real data with random data 
# random data should produce high mean performance but also very high SD of parameters 
# random data should have slightly higher mean (?) but much higher SD
# create single performance measure defined as excess performance over random benchmark: 
# decrease in SD minus wieghted decrease in mean (decrease in SD wieghs more than decrease in mean)
# repeat the above, but instead of optimal in-sample strategy parameters, use median parameters 
# does the difference between optimal and median performance distribution tell something?

# in each segment select the parameters corresponding to a certain performance quantile 
# apply the quantile parameters in other segments, and collect performance distribution 
# this way create performance distributions as function of performance quantile 
# find the performance quantile with the best performance distribution - how does it change with level of noise ? 
# this should demonstrate that the best in-sample parameters are far from the best out-of-sample parameters 

# the performance quantile with the best performance distribution corresponds  
# to a distribution of parameters - which is an ensemble of models 
# does this ensemble of models also have the best backtesting results ?
# this approach using ensembles of models defines a new backtesting paradigm 

# perform the following backtesting exercise 
# perform backtesting, but at each step don't select the optimal parameters, 
# the optimal model likely outperforms beccause it fit to noise 
# instead select the parameters corresponding to a certain performance quantile
