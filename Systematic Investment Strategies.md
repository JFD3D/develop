### Systematic Investment Strategies

+ [ ] in this course we will study both investment and speculation  
The main difference between investment and speculation lies in the time horizon.  
Investment is concerned with capturing maximum returns in the long-run with lower risk, while speculation is concerned with achieving returns over a short period of time.  
Speculation attempts to switch between investments to achieve the best return versus risk.  
Investment attempts to choose the best investments and hold onto them for longer periods, to achieve the best return versus risk over the long term.

### Estimating risk and performance measures: volatility, skew, CVaR, Cornish-Fisher VaR, Modified VaR, risk-return ratios (Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar), package PerformanceAnalytics,  

+ [ ] Normal (Gaussian) distribution is a bad model for price returns, because extreme returns are frequent and determine the mean  
Risk and total return determined by a small number of data points  
For example, half of the return of the stock market over the past 50 years was associated with just 10 days with the greatest daily change (Taleb) ?  
if cumulative returns are mostly generated by a few large returns, then focusing on predicting small returns is a waste of time  
bin the returns according to their magnitude  
what are the cumulative returns for each return magnitude bucket?  
are the cumulative returns for small return magnitude almost zero most of the time?  
study the following statistic: cumulative returns of bucket divided by its magnitude  
large magnitude buckets should have very high variability because they have smaller number of elements

Guttman (1954) and Kaiser (1960, 1970), asserted that in order to be significant, "a factor must account for at least as much variance as an individual variable" (Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994).  
Horn proposed that factors should only be considered significant if they explain a greater proportion of variance than what might be expected from random chance.

Green Factor Models Stock Forecasting.pdf  
quote:  
Fama and French (1992, FF92) measured the dimensionality of the cross-section of expected monthly U.S. stock returns by regressing the potential factors beta, firm size, book-to-market, earnings-to-price and leverage.  
They found that beta was not explanatory of expected returns, but size and book-to-market were, and that they absorbed the explanatory power of  
earnings-to-price and leverage.  
FF92 concluded that the cross-section of expected monthly U.S. stock returns was two-factor, although neither factor was consistent with the CAPM.  
A third factor in the form of 12-month return momentum (Jegadeesh, 1990;  
Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993) was incorporated by Fama and French (1996) and  
Carhart (1997) to create the three-factor model of risks that explain equity returns.

### Forecasting returns and volatility,  

+ [ ] show that it's easier to forecast returns over longer horizons in the future  
compare forecasts of daily returns, weekly, monthly, annual, etc. using past returns over different horizons - weekly, monthly, annual, etc.  
perform apply loops over different horizons  
It's easier to forecast long-term returns (over next decade) than short-term returns (over next year), because long-term returns are determined mostly by economic fundamentals, while short-term returns are determined mostly by speculative returns  
Similarly, it's easier to forecast the weather over a longer term (next Summer) than over a shorter term (next week), but it's also easier to forecast the weather over a very short term (next day)

### Backtesting: cross-validation, parameter regularization, model overfitting, data snooping, data mining,  

+ [ ] verbiage  
cross-validation in machine learning is also called backtesting or walk forward analysis  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtesting  
terminology: formation period or lookback window (in-sample), evaluation period (out-of-sample)  

+ [ ] backtesting rule of thumb is to accept a strategy only if out-of-sample (OOS)  
dictates that a system passes cross-validation if OOS performance is greater than 50% of in-sample (IS) performance.  

+ [ ] two resampling methods: cross-validation and bootstrap

perform backtesting, but at each step don't select the optimal parameters, because the optimal model likely outperforms because it is fit to noise

Antti Ilmanen: The equity risk premium (ERP) refers to the expected return of a broad equity index in excess of some fixed-income alternative.  
Arnott (Research Affiliates):  
The ERP Puzzle: Stocks beat bonds by more than they should.  
Historical excess returns exhibit large negative correlation.  
The correlation between consecutive 10-year stock market excess returns over 10-year government bonds has been a whopping –38 percent.  
When stocks beat bonds by a wide margin in one decade, they reversed with  
reasonable reliability over the next decade.  
This correlation is both statistically significant and economically meaningful.

the Market Portfolio is assumed to be the optimal portfolio with the highest utility under the CAPM model,  
the Market Price of Risk equals the highest Sharpe ratio of the optimal portfolio  
How can Market Portfolio be obtained ?  
What is Market Portfolio isn't it the same as highest Sharpe portfolio ?  
Market Portfolio can be obtained by optimizing Sharpe ratio ?  
The Market Portfolio isn't necessarily equal to the cap-weighted portfolio of all assets  

+ [ ] CAPM holds by construction when market portfolio is the efficient frontier portfolio.  
When individual stock returns are regressed on the efficient portfolio returns, then their residuals are uncorrelated, because if they weren't then a more efficient portfolio could be constructed.  
If the residuals of returns in SML were correlated with each other, then a different Market Portfolio would exist portfolios on the CML satisfy the SML equation  
provide reasons why CAPM may not hold?  
Can Security Market Line (SML) be derived from Capital Market Line (CML)?  
Yes, because if we choose the most efficient portfolio as the reference portfolio for CAPM, then an asset's idiosyncratic returns will on average have mean equal to zero

### Benchmarking portfolio management skill:  

+ [ ] luck versus skill by Michael Mauboussin, head of financial strategies at Credit Suisse and adjunct professor at Columbia Business School

+ [ ] paradox of skill by Michael Mauboussin  
Mauboussin Paradox of Skill.pdf  
The standard deviation of skill goes down over time.  
As skill improves in the population, luck becomes more important in producing outperformance.  
The paradox of skill states that in fields where there is no offsetting interaction (for example, pitcher versus hitter) and no luck, we should see absolute results improve and relative results cluster.  
The variance of quality in consumer goods has narrowed over time, another finding that’s consistent with the paradox of skill.
