#### Structure of a DataCamp course  
-----------------  

[DataCamp github repo](https://github.com/Data-Camp/datacamp)  
[How to create a DataCamp course](https://www.datacamp.com/create/how)  
<br/> <br/>

- [ ] 5 chapters at 50 minutes/chapter = 4 hours, 10 minutes total  
- [ ] Each 50-minute chapter contains  
4 videos at 3.5 minutes/video = 14 minutes  
12 interactive exercises (multiple choice + coding) at 3 minutes/exercise = 36 minutes  
- [ ] Each chapter begins with a video and videos are separated by 3 interactive exercises  
<br/> <br/>

General course concept:  
- each chapter should contain a collection of vignettes,  
- each vignette should explain a particular topic relating to investment management practice,  
- the topics should be illustrated using examples of numerical techniques and investment strategies using historical market data,  
- the vignettes should contain complete R code allowing users to reproduce all the calculations from start to finish, including data loading, formatting, model building, and visualization,  
- all R code samples should rely on fast, vectorized code,  
- the course should teach users how to use popular R packages, such as xts, PerformanceAnalytics, PortfolioAnalytics, 
<br/> <br/>

Potential course themes:  
- Machine Learning for Systematic Investing  
- Investment Portfolio Optimization with R
