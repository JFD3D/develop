Zivot Intro to Computational Finance with R

* contains some time series  
* no quantmod  
* no factor models  
* no active portfolio management strategies  
* contains some CAPM portfolio analysis, but no optimizaton  
* no Machine Learning (backtesting and shrinkage)

practitioner approach  

model regularization shrinkage  

* Loading and scrubbing time series data: packages xts and quantmod, 
* Estimating risk and performance measures: volatility, skew, CVaR, risk-return ratios (Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar), package PerformanceAnalytics, 
* CAPM model: market portfolio, regressions of asset returns, alpha, beta, CML, SML, package PerformanceAnalytics, 
* Factor models: CAPM, Fama-French, Barra, statistical, 
* Asset pricing anomalies: size, value, momentum, volatility,
* Investor risk preferences and utility functions: investor prudence and temperance,
* Kelly and CAPM, 
* Performing rolling calculations using vectorized functions: package caTools, 
* Performing factor model regularization shrinkage  
* Constrained portfolio optimization: Akaike and Bayesian information criteria, coefficient shrinkage, 
* Out-of-sample performance of optimized portfolios,
* Portfolio management strategies: risk parity, minimum correlation, minimum variance, maximum Sharpe, maximum CVaR,
* Estimating model parameters, 
* Forecasting returns and volatility, 
* Active portfolio management strategies: tactical asset allocation, universal portfolios, 
* Strategy backtesting and metaparameter tuning: data snooping, cross-validation, model overfitting, parameter regularization, 
* High Frequency trading strategies: volatility pumping and harvesting, 

I envision each vignette would contain reproducible R code samples, relying on fast, vectorized code.  The R code samples would use actual market data, and would be self-contained and include data loading, formatting and preparation, analysis, model building, and visualization.

* Investment Portfolio Optimization with R

##### comments:  
teach to use packages
xts, PerformanceAnalytics, PortfolioAnalytics, 
backtesting framework
backtesting 


Both are very good, and the course I envision would combine the concepts from these two and move beyond them, as a logical continuation.  Each lecture would consist of several vignettes, each illustrating a particular technique or model.  Here are some topics to start:


I will be travelling over the next few weeks, but I will have time to refocus on this project starting in the second week of December.
